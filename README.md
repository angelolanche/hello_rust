# hello_rust

Those are my first Rust programs, a simple but must 'Hello World', and
a simple Cargo project.

I'm following the book 
[The Rust Programming Language](https://dl.ebooksworld.ir/motoman/No.Starch.Press.The.Rust.Programming.Language.www.EBooksWorld.ir.pdf)
by: Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols,
with contributions from the Rust community

I'll create different repositories for the next Rust projects
