# hello_rust

Those are my first Rust programs, a simple but must 'Hello World', and
a simple Cargo project.

I'm following the book 
[The Rust Programming Language](https://dl.ebooksworld.ir/motoman/No.Starch.Press.The.Rust.Programming.Language.www.EBooksWorld.ir.pdf)
by: Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols,
with contributions from the Rust community

I'll create different repositories for the next Rust projects

I'm also watching the free code camp video about the language

and doing some practical exercises to understand it better
